      <p><b>Flip</b> is a test status change &mdash; either from <i>OK</i> to
        <i>Failure</i>, or vice versa.</p>

      <p><b>Flip Rate</b> is the ratio of such "flips" to the invocation count
        of a given test, measured per agent, per build configuration, or over a
        certain time period.</p>

      <p>A test which constantly fails, while having a 100% <i>failure rate</i>,
        will have its <i>flip rate</i> close to zero; a test which "flips" each
        time it is invoked will have the <i>flip rate</i> close to 100%.</p>
